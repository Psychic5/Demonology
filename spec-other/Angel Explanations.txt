- Cherubim -
Cherubim are a low class angel that act as servants for upper angels. They are composed of solid gold and are powered by the soul engine in their core. They lack any form of authority, and therefor have no mouths to speak with.

- Virtues -
The Virtues are a legion of powerful angels composed of platinum flesh and hearts of gold. Their lower, larger halo contains their soul, while the upper halo contains the soul of a concept. They were all directly designed by the Overlord and each direct a different Force of Order. They are accompanied by groups of Cherubim, which act as servants and guards.

- Powers -
Powers are warrior angels forged by the Ophanim. Their surface is made of solid steel, with their core being more than three times as powerful as the Virtues they protect, as in the fact that a Power acompanies every Virtue on an excursion to the surface world.

- Weepers -
Weeper is an umbrella term used to reference all treasonous angels. This can include angels that stopped serving the Overlord's hierarchy, or angels that never participated in it, such as Nephilim.

- Cupid -
The Cupid is a modified Cherub covered in a thin coat of platinum. It was produced in secret by the Virtue of Valor in attempt to give itself some time to relax while a lower angel does its hard work. Unfortunately the Cupid ran away in no time at all, and quickly became a Weeper. Before the End, the Cupid would use its specialised magic to curse the citizens of the Overworld with bad love.

- Flicker -
Flickers are a rare subspecies of Cherubim with the bizarre ability to reproduce. They are composed of many unique materials but overall have the same strength and intelligence as the average Cherub. However the entirety of the Flicker species is made up of Weepers. They wander the Overworld, reaping the souls of the unwary, and adding them to their collection of halos.

- Nephilim -
A half-angel, outcasted by the greater celestial society. The other half of a Nephilim is usually a demon, since demons are the most common creatures that average angels can reproduce with. Nephilim may also be the result of a Chimera involving an angel. Usually the latter is the far safer option.

- Ophanim -
The Thrones. The Galgalim. The Wheels. The Ophanim... The right hand angels of the Overlord. They are to be trusted more than any other being of the light. Powerful sculptors of the world. Unlike other angels, they are made of clay, rather than metal.

- The Overlord -
The embodiment of light. The Overlord speaks with a godly amount of disembodied mouths. Its word is order.
