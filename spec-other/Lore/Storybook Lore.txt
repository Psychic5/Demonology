Once upon a time, two forces ruled over the Overworld and Nether; Light, and Dark.

The force of Light embodies order, conformity, and the Overworld.
The force of Dark embodies chaos, life, and the Nether.

For eons, the two forces fought over the universe, the Light fighting with planned excursions, and heavy-hitting angelic soldiers. The Dark fighting with chaotic brute attacks, with hundreds of fodder demons.

But nothing was ever done, the world was in pure balance despite the constant arguing.

The two forces could not grow, but could not be destroyed.
